### Status:


We were communicating alot today and working together on the wireframe, How the wireframe was set up was mostly done by Fuad, Garðar fixed the document to have most of the data and did some user testing, Jón did the Model class diagram and the Data class diagram.

We were told that our idea of a class diagram was incorrect, And thus we Changed it to be two diagrams one for The Model class diagram and another for The UI, Logic, Data class diagram.

We changed how the happy path was supposed to work after some discussion and with very useful user feedback.
